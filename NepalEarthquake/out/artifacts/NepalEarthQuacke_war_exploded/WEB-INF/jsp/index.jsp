  <div class="panel panel-default">

  <div class="row">

		  <p><strong>1.</strong>Nepal earthquake of 2015, also called Gorkha earthquake, severe earthquake 
		  that struck near the city of Kathmandu in central Nepal on April 25, 2015. About 9,000
		  people were killed, many thousands more were injured, and more than 600,000 structures
		  in Kathmandu and other nearby towns were either damaged or destroyed. The earthquake was
		  felt throughout central and eastern Nepal, much of the Ganges River plain in northern India, 
		  and northwestern Bangladesh, as well as in the southern parts of the Plateau of Tibet and western Bhutan.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-sm-4 col">
		  		  <p><strong>2.</strong>The initial shock, which registered a moment magnitude of 7.8, struck shortly before noon local time (about 06:11 am Greenwich Mean Time). Its epicentre was about 21 miles (34 km) east-southeast of Lamjung and 48 miles (77 km) northwest of Kathmandu, and its focus was 9.3 miles (about 15 km) underground. Two large aftershocks, with magnitudes 6.6 and 6.7, shook the region within one hour of the main quake, and several dozen smaller aftershocks occurred in the region during the succeeding days. On May 12 a magnitude-7.3 aftershock struck some 76 km (47 miles) east-northeast of Kathmandu, killing more than 100 people and injuring nearly 1,900.</p>
		  </div>
		  		  <div class="col-sm-4 col">
		  		  <p><strong>3.</strong>The Himalayan region is one of the most seismically active in the world, but large earthquakes have occurred there infrequently. Before the 2015 temblor, the most recent large earthquake (that is, magnitude 6.0 or above) took place in 1988. That magnitude-6.9 event resulted in the deaths of 1,500 people. A magnitude-8.0 earthquake in 1934, however, killed approximately 10,600 people.</p></div>
		  		  <div class="col-sm-4 col">
		  		  <p><strong>4.</strong>Initial reports of casualties following the early-morning earthquake put the death toll in the hundreds, but, as the day wore on, reports had the total number of fatalities surpassing 1,000 and nearing 1,900 by the end of the day. Within two weeks after the main quake occurred, rescue teams had reached all the remote villages in the earthquake zone, and a more-accurate picture of the earthquake’s human cost emerged. The deaths of approximately 9,000 people (which included fatalities in nearby parts of India, China, and Bangladesh) were confirmed, with nearly 16,800 injured and some 2.8 million people displaced by the earthquake. One United Nations (UN) report mentioned that more than eight million people (more than one-fourth of Nepal’s population) were affected by the event and its aftermath.</p></div>				 
		  		  <div class="col-sm-4 col">
		  		  <p><strong>5.</strong>Immediately after the quake, the Nepalese government declared a state of emergency, and soon nearly the entire Nepalese army was assisting in rescue and recovery work. Nepal also called on the international community for aid. The UN quickly established the “Nepal Earthquake 2015 Flash Appeal” fund, whose goal was to raise an estimated $415 million for Nepal’s earthquake relief. By some two weeks after the earthquake, more than $330 million had been either provided directly or pledged.</p></div>
				  
				  <div class="col-sm-4 col">
		  		  <p><strong>6.</strong>India, China, and several other countries quickly responded by sending in aid and rescue teams. The delivery of relief services to the people in need during the first few days after the earthquake occurred, however, was complicated by the remoteness of many villages from the existing transportation network, congestion at Kathmandu’s international airport, and a shortage of heavy trucks, helicopters, and other vehicles capable of transporting supplies. In addition, earthquake debris—along with “tent cities” erected in streets and other open areas by Kathmandu residents who feared going back to their homes—contributed to making many of the city’s streets virtually impassable, hampering efforts by rescuers to reach people still trapped in the rubble. The debris was gradually cleared.</p></div>
